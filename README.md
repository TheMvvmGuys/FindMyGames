# FindMyGames
A next-gen game launcher!

**FindMyGames** is a modern game launcher built with .NET and WPF (We may have an additional cross-platform AvaloniaUI app).

### How does it work
**FindMyGames** scans your drive and searches for specific game folders - it then verifies them and fetches metadata and images of them from various APIs - this is all being done client-side

## Release
We are far from a working release yet, however we are trying to speed the production procedure as much as we can.
